## üíª For Users with Limited System Resources

If you're working with high-resolution footage (8K+) on a computer with limited RAM (16GB or less), we recommend these settings:

1. When using interactive mode, select the **"low_memory"** or **"minimal"** quality mode
2. Enable the **"Low memory mode"** option when prompted
3. Consider processing to a lower output resolution (like 1080p) first to verify results

These settings will use a single processing thread which dramatically reduces memory usage but increases processing time.

## üé• What This Tool Does

- **Converts Specialized Camera Output**: Transforms tiled HEVC camera footage into standard MP4 files that you can play in any video player
- **Automatic Processing**: Handles complex tasks like parsing manifest files, validating footage segments, and assembling the final video
- **Multiple Resolution Options**: Create videos in various resolutions from 720p to full 8K+
- **Works Everywhere**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üìö Complete Documentation

- [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) - Detailed installation and usage instructions for all platforms
- [Command Reference](docs/COMMAND_REFERENCE.md) - All available commands and options
- [Input Structure](docs/INPUT_STRUCTURE.md) - Details about the expected directory structure for camera footage

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quality and Performance Settings

| Mode | Quality | Speed | Memory Usage | Recommended For |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| quality | Highest | Slowest | High | High-end systems, final outputs |
| balanced | Good | Medium | Medium | Most systems (default) |
| performance | Lower | Fast | Medium | Quick previews |
| low_memory | Good | Slow | Low | Systems with 8-16GB RAM |
| minimal | Lower | Slowest | Lowest | Systems with <8GB RAM |
