### Step 3: Download and Set Up COSM C360 Tools

1. **Download the tool**:
   - Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/frontierkodiak/cosm-c360-tools/releases)
   - Download the latest ZIP file (`cosm-c360-tools.zip` or similar)
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   - Open Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the tool:
     ```
     # Example on Windows (change to your actual path)
     cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\cosm-c360-tools
     
     # Example on macOS/Linux (change to your actual path)
     cd ~/Downloads/cosm-c360-tools
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     For macOS/Linux, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`

## üíª Using the Tool

### Interactive Mode (Recommended for All Users)

Interactive mode guides you through the entire process with simple prompts and explanations:

1. **Start the tool**:
   - Open Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Navigate to the tool directory (if you're not already there)
   - Run:
     ```
     python cosmos.py --interactive
     ```
     For macOS/Linux, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`

2. **Follow the interactive prompts**:
   - **Input directory**: Select the folder containing your COSM camera footage
   - **Output directory**: Choose where you want the processed MP4 files to be saved
   - **Job name**: Give your processing job a name (or use the default)
   - **Output resolution**: Choose from preset options (4K, 1080p, etc.) or specify custom dimensions
   - **Quality mode**: Select the processing quality/speed balance that fits your needs
   - **Low memory mode**: Enable if you have limited RAM (recommended for 16GB or less)

3. **Review your selections** and confirm to begin processing

4. **Wait for processing to complete**:
   - The tool will display progress updates as it works
   - Processing time depends on your computer's performance and the footage size
   - When complete, your converted MP4 files will be available in the output directory

### Command Line Mode (For Advanced Users)

If you prefer using command line arguments instead of interactive prompts:

```
python cosmos.py --input-dir /path/to/input --output-dir /path/to/output --job-name MyJob
```

#### Windows Path Format Example:
```
python cosmos.py --input-dir C:\Users\YourName\Videos\COSM_Input --output-dir C:\Users\YourName\Videos\COSM_Output
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Output Resolution

Choose the size of your output video:

| Resolution | Dimensions | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| original | 9280√ó6300 | Full source resolution (very large files) |
| 8K | 7680√ó4320 | Ultra high definition (large files) |
| 4K | 3840√ó2160 | Default, good balance of quality and size |
| 1080p | 1920√ó1080 | Standard HD, smaller files |
| 720p | 1280√ó720 | Smallest file size, good for sharing |

Custom resolutions can be specified using the format `WIDTHxHEIGHT`

### Processing Quality Modes

| Mode | Quality | Speed | Memory Usage | Recommended For |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| quality | Highest | Slowest | High | Final outputs on powerful computers |
| balanced | Good | Medium | Medium | Most users (default) |
| performance | Lower | Fast | Medium | Quick previews |
| low_memory | Good | Slow | Low | Systems with 8-16GB RAM |
| minimal | Lower | Slowest | Lowest | Systems with <8GB RAM |

### For Resource-Constrained Systems (16GB RAM or less)

If you're processing high-resolution footage on a computer with limited resources:

1. Use **low_memory** or **minimal** quality mode
2. Enable the **Low memory mode** option when prompted
3. Consider processing to a lower resolution first (like 1080p)
4. Make sure no other memory-intensive applications are running
5. When using command line mode, add these flags:
   ```
   --quality-mode minimal --low-memory
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Python or Command Not Found

**Problem**: When you run a command, you get "python not found" or "command not found" error

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you're in the correct directory where the tool is located
- Try using `python3` instead of `python` (especially on macOS/Linux)
- Verify Python is installed correctly: Run `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- Restart your Command Prompt or Terminal after installing Python

### FFmpeg Not Found

**Problem**: The tool reports that FFmpeg is not found or not installed

**Solutions**:
- Verify FFmpeg is installed: Run `ffmpeg -version`
- If installed but not found:
  - On Windows: Make sure you added FFmpeg to your PATH and restarted the Command Prompt
  - On macOS/Linux: Try installing again with `brew install ffmpeg` or `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Out of Memory Errors

**Problem**: The tool crashes or your computer becomes unresponsive during processing

**Solutions**:
- Enable Low Memory Mode: Run with `--low-memory` flag or select this option in interactive mode
- Use the "minimal" quality mode: Add `--quality-mode minimal` or select in interactive mode
- Process a lower resolution output first
- Close other applications while processing
- Temporarily increase your system's virtual memory/swap file

### Input Directory Problems

**Problem**: The tool can't find your camera footage or reports missing files

**Solutions**:
- Make sure the input directory has the correct structure (see [Input Structure](INPUT_STRUCTURE.md))
- Verify that the manifest file is in the top-level directory
- Check if you have read permissions for all the files

### Output Directory Problems

**Problem**: The tool can't write output files or reports permission errors

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you have write permissions for the output directory
- Check available disk space (10GB+ recommended)
- Use a shorter, simpler path for your output directory

## üì± Advanced Features

### Saving and Loading Configurations

When you find settings that work well, you can save them for future use:

1. In interactive mode, when prompted, choose to save your configuration
2. Give your configuration a name (e.g., "MySettings")
3. To use these settings later, select "Load existing configuration" at the start of interactive mode

### Using Custom CRF Values

The Constant Rate Factor (CRF) controls the quality and file size balance of the video encoding:

- Lower values (18-23) produce higher quality but larger files
- Higher values (24-28) produce smaller files with lower quality
- The default is to use an appropriate value based on your quality mode
- Advanced users can specify a custom value with the `--crf` option

### Processing Specific Manifest Files

If your input directory contains multiple manifest files, you can specify which one to use:

```
python cosmos.py --input-dir /path/to/input --output-dir /path/to/output --manifest /path/to/specific_manifest.xml
```
